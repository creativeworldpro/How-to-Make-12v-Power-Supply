In this project, we'll teach you making a simple 12v power supply circuit. DC-12V is the standard voltage, or nominal voltage for the North American side of AC electrical power. It is termed as positive potential in DC and negative potential in AC.

As per IEEE convention, the voltage level 0V represents ground potential.


DC -12V is a voltage and current supply for gadgets. It is used to provide power to the devices that use DC -12V such as digital cameras, laptops, mp3 players and other battery operated devices.


Component List - 

To make this power supply circuit, we might need some electronics component. 

Those component lists have to been given below.

Component List:

1. PCB – made by JLCPCB

2. Rectifier Diode - 1N 5399

3. LED – 5mm

5. Resistor – 1 KΩ

6. Capacitor - 2200µf/ 35v

7. Transformer - 12.0.12 v

8. DC - 12v


Feature of DC-12v - 

•	12V regulated power supplies

•	12V unregulated power supplies

In addition, the 12V regulated power supply has three subgroups

•	Switching regulator AC to DC

•	Linear regulator AC to DC

•	Switching regulator DC to DC


Circuit Connection - Step 1

We make bridge power supply circuit. To make this bridge power connection, we need 4 pieces rectifier diode. 
We know that, there are two polarity terminal of a diode. To make this bridge connection, we connect two diode negative terminal and connect due two diode positive terminal with the circuit.

Then we connect, two set diode positive leg with another diode negative leg and connect other terminal with the circuit. It’s a complete bridge connection.


Circuit Connection - Step 2

To filter voltage, we need to use a capacitor with the circuit. We are using 2200µf/ 35v capacitor with this circuit. We connect capacitor negative leg with diode negative leg and connect capacitor positive leg with diode positive leg.


Circuit Connection - Step 3

For indicator, now we connect resistor and LED with the circuit. We are using 1k resistor to make this circuit. We connect resistor with capacitor positive leg and connect LED positive leg with resistor. Then connect LED negative leg with positive & negative leg of diode.


Circuit Connection - Step 4

For power source we are using 12v transformer. If we want to make 15v power supply, for that we need to connect 15v transformer. Now we connect transformer secondary section with the circuit. We connect secondary section cable with diode positive and negative leg.


Circuit Connection - Step 5

Now we connect dc-12v LED light or motor or any kind of electronic gadget device with the circuit. We connect device positive cable with capacitor positive cable and connect capacitor negative cable with device negative cable.

Our device is now completely ready for use. We use DC-12v led light to test the project circuit.


Soldering and Cleaning -

Neat and perfect soldering is an important part for all kind of PCBs. Since soldering, you should remember that, there should not be any kind of short circuit connection. After soldering all leg, we cut-off the extra leg of all electronics component.

We also can use liquid PCB cleaner to clean the PCB board.


Final Action - 

Our power supply circuit is now ready for use. Now we just need to connect AC cable with AC line and to operate the amazing project circuit.
Again thanks to JLCPCB for best quality PCBs.
