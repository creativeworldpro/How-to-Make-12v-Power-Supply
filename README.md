# How-to-Make-12v-Power-Supply
In this project, we'll teach you making a simple 12v power supply circuit. DC-12V is the standard voltage, or nominal voltage for the North American side of AC electrical power. It is termed as positive potential in DC and negative potential in AC. As per IEEE convention, the voltage level 0V represents ground potential.
